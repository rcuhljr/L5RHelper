DB Schema - Profiles are one per character they store baseline stats and skills. There are Many to one templates to profiles. 
A template is a set of bonuses/penalties that can be used to represent changes in combat. (I'm going slower then someone, or perhaps if I have a shuggie stat buff)

    "any edits a user makes are effectively made immediately without requiring an additional confirmation step. 
     Supporting this model is generally a simple matter of following two rules:
      
      When creating a new document, the backing database entry or file for it is created immediately. 
      For example, if the user chooses to write a new e-mail, a new entry for that e-mail is created as soon 
      as they start entering data, so that if they go to any other activity after that point this e-mail will
      now appear in the list of drafts.
      
      When an activity's onPause() method is called, it should commit to the backing content provider or file any
      changes the user has made. This ensures that those changes will be seen by any other activity that is about 
      to run. You will probably want to commit your data even more aggressively at key times during your activity's
      lifecycle: for example before starting a new activity, before finishing your own activity, when the user switches 
      between input fields, etc."
